# Estimation and System-Identification

 ## This repository contains my **System-Identification** course projects:


:one: The **Linear Static Systems** is the main subject of this project. In this assignment I have investigated the  properties of linear-regression and its application in parameter-estimation and structure identification. Moreover, various implementation of least squre such as Regularied-Regression(RLS), Orthonormal-Least-Square (OLS) has been studied as well. In order to solve the problem related to the covariance of the estimation some methods such as RLS with forgetting factor, Covariance resetting, and Kalman-Filter has been applied on the problem and discussed profoundly. This assignment alos consider the effect of regressors on the estimation and some well-known apporaches such as Backward-Elimination and Forward-Selection has been studied elaborately. Effects of noise on each implementation and the importance of utilizing different norms is the topic of this assignment as well.

 :two: The **Linear Dynamical Systems** and their models are the main subjects of this project. This includes: 1. **Various Model Structures**, 2. **Order of Polynomials**, **Variance of Noise**, and 4. **Delay**. I have applied **AR, ARX, ARARX, ARMAX, OE, and BJ Models** in order to compare each model traits.
